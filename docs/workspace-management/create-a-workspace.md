5. You can cancel the current settings at any time by clicking the Cancel button, and when you cancel, the settings window will be closed and you will be returned to the previous screen.

6. If the current workspace being used is not your own, you can still access the **Workspace > Setting** menu, but you will only be able to view information and will not have any editing or creation permissions.
